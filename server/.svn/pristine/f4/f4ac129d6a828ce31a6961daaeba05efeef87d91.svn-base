To compile and run the server, you will need visual studio.  Currently you can get the Visual Studio 2012 express Desktop edition (or something like that) for free through Microsoft's website.  Once you have it installed, just open 
RunUO Shard/RunUO Shard.sln

Note that all MyRunUO / database stuff has been stripped from the Rel Por code (it was highly customized anyway).  If you are interested in using a database to track in-game stuff, you might look into integrating MyRunUO.

Scripts/Misc/DataPath.cs -- change your
private static string CustomPath = @"C:\Ultima Online"
to wherever your client files are

Note that I believe the [telgen command has pretty much all the dungeon's teleporter locations correctly set now.

After a fresh rel por server start, I think (I actually am not an expert in jumpstarting factions and citizenship) that you simply need to run the following chain of commands to get the towns and factions going:

[GenerateTownships
[GenerateFactions
[ResetHeroes
